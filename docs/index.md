This is the official documentation of the Chaos League Stream Game created by DoodleChaos.

[repo]: https://github.com/chaosleaguewiki/chaosleaguewiki.github.io

## What is Chaos League

Chaos League is a Stream-interaction Game, meaning the viewers of the stream can participate in it. It is maintained and run by the YouTuber DoodleChaos.

## The Goal

The goal of the game is simple: Capture the Throne, that is visible in the middle of the screen at the top, and keep it as long as you can.

Check the [`Attacking the King` page][attacking-the-king] for more info.

### Earning Points

To earn points, you have to participate in Minigames. To participate, you have to either spend Channel Points or Bits to buy "tickets".  
Each ticket bought will be added to a Prize that the winner of the Minigame can earn. The more tickets bought, the higher the Prize will be.
