Chaos League can be easily streamed by Twitch streamers themself. To do this, follow the below guide.

## Requirements

To run the game, you first need to meet certain requirements, namely:

- You use Windows. Chaos League only supports Windows right now.
- You are a Twitch afiliate or have access to a Twitch afiliate channel.
    The game relies on Twitch's channel point system which are only available for afiliates. [[Affiliate Requirements](https://help.twitch.tv/s/article/twitch-affiliate-program-faq?language=en_US)]

## Setup

2. Extract the downloaded Zip file's content.
    
    ![extract files](../assets/images/setup/extract-files.png){ loading="lazy" }

3. **[Optional]** Customize the Point sprite.
    - Navigate to the `StreamingAssets` folder (`CLLGen3PublicV0.32/CLLGen3PublicV0.32_Data/StreamingAssets/`)
    - Replace `communityPointSprite.png` with your own PNG file. The file must be the same dimension!
4. Double-click the `CLLGen3PublicV0.32.exe` file to start the game.
5. Grant access for public and private networks for the app.

6. A popup should appear on your browser where you get asked to authorize ChaosLeaguePublic using your Twitch account. You may need to first login into your Twitch account. Authorize the requested permissions to allow the game to run automatically.
