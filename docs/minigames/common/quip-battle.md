**Quip Battle** is a Game where the players provide an answer to a random question or complete a random sentence.

The game only starts when at least 2 players are participating, at which point a 15 second timer starts until the Game itself will begin.

## Gameplay

Each player can provide an answer to a randomly selected sentence or question, which will be displayed next to their marble.  
At the same time will a Poll be started in the Stream chat with each player as a selectable answer. Every viewer can then select the player with the best answer.

Once the time is up will the player with the most votes be selected as the winner. There can be multiple 1st place.

/// note
The game will display the last message a player send in chat, meaning if the player sends a new message will it be displayed in the game.
