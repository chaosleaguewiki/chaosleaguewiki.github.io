# Terminology

This page explains the different terms used throughout the wiki in order to help understand what something means or refers to.

## Marble

`Marble` refers to the representation of a player in the game itself. Whenever a player joins a queue, [attacks the king](../../mechanics/attacking-the-king.md) or plays in a tile, they will be displayed as a circle with their avatar on it.  
The term is a bit misleading tho since the players are technically speaking not a marble, but rather a flat disc.

## Ticket

`Ticket` refers to the digital form of currency used to join a game. Players use their channel points or bits to have them be translated into so-called spawn tickets, the rate at which this happens is 1:1.  
Tickets can't be used for anything else, while the channel points, which also are named tickets, can be used for other things.

## Tile

`Tile` refers to a minigame that is displayed on either the left or right side. A tile always has a specific rarity and name.

## Bits

`Bits` refers to the virtual currency offered by the Streaming platform Twitch. It should not be confused with the term bidding, which refers to spending spawn tickets.

## Gap

A `Gap` is a component of a [Tile](#tile) and is also often referred to as a "bucket".

A Gap can exist in two states, open and closed, and may have different point values. Closed gaps always take points from a player and transfer them over to the current king, while open gaps give a player points. The amount they get depends on the number the gap displays while they fall through it.  
Two unique gaps in the form of a infinity and angel gap only exist in the games [Zero or Hero] and [Chicken Out]. Former takes all the points of the player while later doesn't take any points. Later also only exists while a infinity gap is inside a [Rebellion's effect Area](../../mechanics/rebellion.md).

The gap can increase its own point value when a player passes through it. Whether this is possible is indicated by a colored line on top of the gap.

- Gaps having a grey colored line don't change their values, meaning a gap displaying 5 will always give or take 5 points.
- Gaps displaying a blue line will increase their value by 1, meaning a gap displaying 5 will display 6 after a player passed through it, then 7, then 8, etc.
- Gaps displaying a purple line will increase their value by their starting value, meaning a gap displaying 5 will display 10 after a player passed through it, then 15, 20, etc.

## Block

`Block` refers to a square shown in the wall between the `!attack` pipe and the current King.

The mechanics of this object is described in the [Attacking the King](../../mechanics/attacking-the-king.md) page.
