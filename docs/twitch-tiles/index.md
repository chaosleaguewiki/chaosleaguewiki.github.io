# Twitch Tiles

Chaos League offers various tiles to participate in.

Tiles exist in two forms: [Minigame tiles](#available-minigame-tiles) and [Shop tiles](#available-shop-tiles).  
Minigame tiles give or take points from every participating player with a prize at the end being distributed to all participants with 1st place getting 100% of the prize and everyone else getting a certain percentage of the prize based on their ranking.

Shop tiles allow players to buy cosmetics for their marble using gold.

No matter the type of tile, there is always one active while the other is in queue mode.

Shop tiles and certain minigame tiles may be skipped should no player join its queue for 15 seconds after the previous tile has finished.

## Rarities

Each tile can appear as one or multiple rarities. Depending on the rarity will certain factors such as the base prize to win be different.

Here is a list of all currently available rarities, the aproximate chance of them appearing and the factor at which they increase the prize value and points you can earn in a tile:

| Rarity    | Chance | Point increase | Start Prize |
|-----------|-------:|---------------:|------------:|
