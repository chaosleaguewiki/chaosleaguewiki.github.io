# Combo Breaker

{{ game.info(
  inputs = "Bidding tickets to change Pipe exit.",
  added  = "v0.33 Alpha"
) }}

**Combo Breaker** is a minigame tile added in v0.33 Alpha of Chaos League.

## Gameplay

Players are droped in at the top and move down the tile in a reverse S-Shape-like pattern, passing through a splitting pipe.  
By default will the pipe drop the players to the left side, where they fall through a gap, receiving points before re-appearing again at the top pipe. Should a player bid a ticket while in the tile will they exit to the right of the splitting pipe, hitting a red button which causes a gate to move and redirect all other players to an elimination block. The player who pressed the button will be moved into a gap where they receive a much higher number of points.  
Any extra player who moved to the right, but didn't get into the gap, will be moved down and re-appear at the top, as if they exited the splitting pipe to the left.

## Point multiplier

A point multiplier is located at the top left of the tile, displaying x2.  
Every 4 minutes, it will increase the point values of the gaps and elimination block by a factor of 2. In addition is a [death ball](../../mechanics/death-ball.md) spawned that eliminates players it touches. Unlike any other death ball does this one have a much shorter cooldown, eliminating players much faster.
